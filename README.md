“EFFICEINT ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION SYSTEM: FPGA Implementation of Cryptographic Algorithms using Verilog”

The "internet of things" (IoT), a well-known technology, is made up of numerous
embedded devices, sensors, and other things connected to the Internet. There are several
applications that use it. Because of how quickly this technology has developed, it
currently accounts for a sizable fraction of current research interests. Most Internet of
Things (IoT) devices are built with the capability of gathering various types of data
from a variety of sources and transmitting it digitally. Data security is the most
important problem with IoT technology since it significantly affects the privacy of
important data. In this study, a novel, lightweight, resource-constrained 16-bit, 32-bit,
64-bit and 128-bit symmetric key encryption technique have been suggested for IoT
devices for the efficient encryption and decryption process that can offer data security
at the sensing level. This algorithm increased security by combining the structural
benefits of the substitution-permutation network (SPN) and the Feistel structure. In this
project, we have designed the encryption and decryption modules for 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-
bit and 128-bit and simulated all the modules on Xilinx Vivado software. We are
planning to evaluate the proposed method on the NEXYS 4 DDR FPGA (Artix-7)
trainer kit, we are using Xilinx Vivado EDA tool.
